# calculator
A mobile-first designed responsive calculator with addition, subtract, multiplication, division, sign-swapping, percentage, and clear functions. UI modeled after Apple's Iphone Caclulator app. 

This was a project completed as part of the ODIN Project's curriculum. My first attempt at this problem I used data-attributes to bind required data to the DOM. Prefering to work primarily in my Javascript file and with OOP in mind, I refactored my code to store all pertinent data as property values on a single calculator object, and use that data to run calculations and update the display. 

Concepts on display:
HTML/CSS
Responsive Design, Custom Breakpoints
Javascript: 
Event Listeners, DOM Manipulation, using advanced Array operations(.map),
